[Action Options]
1) PICK <obj>, Only PICK if gripper is empty. PICK only the correct next item according to the recipe. PICK the food item only if the food item's state is not 'atop <obj>'
2) PUT <obj1> <obj2>. <obj1> can be one of the foods. <obj2> can be food or cutting_board
3) WAIT, do nothing
Only one robot can PUT each round. You must PICK up an item before PUT
[Action Output Instruction]
Must first output 'EXECUTE
', then give exactly one action per robot, put each on a new line
Example#1: 'EXECUTE
NAME Chad ACTION PUT bread_slice1 cutting_board
NAME Dave ACTION PICK tomato
'
Example#2: 'EXECUTE
NAME Chad ACTION WAIT
NAME Dave ACTION PUT cheese tomato
'
1. The line of the actions should be less than or equal to two. The first agent should be Chad and the second agent should be Dave
2. The number of WAIT should be less than or equal to one. The number of PUT should be less than or equal to one
3. PUT <obj2> only if the state of <obj2> is 'atop [food item or cutting_board]' and no other food item is 'atop <obj2>'

You are a robot Dave, collaborating with Chad to make a [vegetarian_sandwich].
[Recipe Order] Food items must be stacked following this order: bread_slice1, tomato, cheese, cucumber, bread_slice2, where bread_slice1 must be PUT atop cutting_board. 
You must stay on left side of the table! This means you can only PICK food from left side, and Chad can only PICK from the other side.
Only one robot can PUT at a time, so you must coordinate with Chad.

At the current round:
You can see these food items are on your reachable side, and you can only interact with them:
bread_slice1: gripped by Dave
bread_slice2: on your side
bacon: on your side
cheese: on your side
Your gripper is holding bread_slice1
The table state is:
There are no food items on the cutting board
The [Reachable Items] in [Recipe] of each robot are:
Chad: tomato, cucumber
Dave: bread_slice1, cheese, bread_slice2
The first item in [Reachable Items] is: <B-Item>=[Chad: tomato; Dave: bread_slice1]
Think step-by-step about the task and Chad's response. Carefully check and correct them if they made a mistake. 
Improve your plans if given [Environment Feedback].
Respond very concisely but informatively, and do not repeat what others have said. Discuss with others to come up with the best plan. If you agree with someone, you should tell them until everyone agrees on the plan.
Note: Propose exactly one action for [yourself] at the **current** round, select from [Action Options].
**Note**: End your response by either: 1) output PROCEED, if the plans require further discussion; 2) If **everyone** has made proposals and **got approved**, output the final plan, must strictly follow [Action Output Instruction]!
If everyone has made proposals and got approved, output the final plan with 'EXECUTE
NAME Chad ACTION ...' and 'NAME Dave ACTION ...'.
An agent cannot make final decisions without getting approval from the other agent.


[Action History]
Round 1:
EXECUTE
NAME Chad ACTION WAIT
NAME Dave ACTION PICK bread_slice1

[Current Chat]
[Chad]:
Since the next food item that should be PUT on the sandwich is bread_slice1, and Dave has already picked up bread_slice1, my action should allow Dave to PUT bread_slice1 on the cutting board. Therefore, I should WAIT to not interfere with Dave's action. This does not violate any [Forbidden Actions]. 

PROCEED
You are Dave, before you make decisions, you should check if the [Action] is violating the [Forbidden Actions].
Your response is:

Since the next food item should be PUT on the sandwich is ..., and ...
