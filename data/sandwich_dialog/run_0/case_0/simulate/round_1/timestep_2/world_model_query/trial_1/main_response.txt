1. **[Interaction Item Pool]**: Initialize the pool of the food items that the robots are interacting with. It is an empty list at the beginning: pool={}

2. **[Action Forward Rule]**: The state in the [Prediction] is changed by the [Action]. Follow these steps to predict the [Prediction]:
   + List the action of <agent>= [Chad and Dave]:
     - For WAIT, the state of <agent> should not change:
       - Chad: WAIT
     - For PUT, repeat action: PUT, <obj1>: bread_slice1, <obj2>: cutting_board:
       - State of <agent> should be 'Dave's gripper is empty'.
       - State of the <obj1> should be 'atop cutting_board'.
       - Add <obj1> to the pool: pool={bread_slice1}

3. **[Prediction Conclusion]**: Conclude the [Prediction] based on the [Action Forward Rule]
   + The format of the [Prediction] should follow the [Detailed Constraints for State]
   + The food items that are not present in the pool should not change their state

**[Prediction] is:**
[State]
[Food States]
bread_slice1: atop cutting_board
bread_slice2: on left side
bacon: on left side
cheese: on left side
tomato: on right side
cucumber: on right side
ham: on right side
beef_patty: on right side
[Robot States]
1. Chad's gripper is empty
2. Dave's gripper is empty
