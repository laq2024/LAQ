Since the next food item that should be PUT on the sandwich is bread_slice1, and this item is on Dave's side, I cannot interact with it directly. Dave should PICK bread_slice1 and PUT it on the cutting_board as it is the first item in the recipe order and there are no items on the cutting board currently, making it valid for Dave to PUT bread_slice1 there.

Since I am on the right side and bread_slice1 is not on my side, my only valid action at this moment is to WAIT.

Dave, if you agree with this plan, we can finalize the actions according to our discussion.
