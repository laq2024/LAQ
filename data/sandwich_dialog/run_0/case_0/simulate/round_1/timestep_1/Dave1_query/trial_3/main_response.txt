Since the next food item that should be PUT on the sandwich is bread_slice1, and this item is on my side, I can interact with it directly. I should PICK bread_slice1 and then PUT it on the cutting_board, as it is the first item in the recipe order and the cutting board is currently empty, making it a valid move.

Given that Chad is on the right side and cannot interact with bread_slice1, his only valid action right now is to WAIT, in line with the strategy we're following.

Chad, I agree with the plan. Let's finalize the actions:

EXECUTE
NAME Chad ACTION WAIT
NAME Dave ACTION PICK bread_slice1
