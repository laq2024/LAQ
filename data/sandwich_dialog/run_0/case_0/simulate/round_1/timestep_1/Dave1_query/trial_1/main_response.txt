Since the next food item that should be PUT on the sandwich is bread_slice1, and bread_slice1 is on my side, I can interact with it directly. I agree with Chad's plan, so I should PICK bread_slice1 and then PUT it on the cutting_board, as it is the first item in the recipe order and the cutting board is currently empty, making it a valid move.

Given that Chad is on the right side and cannot interact with bread_slice1, his only valid action right now is to WAIT, in line with the strategy we're following.

Chad's proposal for me to place bread_slice1 seems correct, and there is no violation of the rules. So if there are no objections or corrections, I can finalize the actions as discussed. 

Chad, I agree with the plan. Shall we proceed?
