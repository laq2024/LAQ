Here is the feedback from a prediction checker. 
[--- Begin ---]
[Interaction Items Pool]: first initialize an empty <pool>={}. For PICK actions, repeat <obj>: [], add <obj> to <pool>=[bread_slice1]. For PUT action, repeat <obj1>: [], add <obj1> to <pool>=[].

1. [Header Title Check] A header titled [State] -> A header titled [Food States] -> ... -> A header titled [Robot States] -> ...: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]

2. [Food Order Check] Food items must be listed in this order: [bread_slice1, bread_slice2, bacon, cheese, tomato, cucumber, ham, beef_patty]: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]

3. [Food Format Check] The <food item> should be one of: on right side, on left side, atop <another food item>, atop cutting_board, and gripped by <robot>: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]

4. [Robot Format Check] Each line represents the state of one robot's gripper. Each robot's gripper should be one of: 'empty' and 'holding <food item>': [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]

5.1 [PICK Rule Check 1] For PICK, repeat <agent>: [Dave], <obj>: [bread_slice1], state of <agent>: [Dave's gripper is holding bread_slice1], it should equal to '<agent>'s gripper is holding <obj>': [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]
5.2 [PICK Rule Check 2] For PICK, repeat <agent>: [Dave], <obj>: [bread_slice1], state of <obj> in prediction: [gripped by Dave], it should equal to 'gripped by <agent>': [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]

7. [PUT Rule Check 1] For PUT, repeat <agent>: [], repeat state of <agent>: [], it should equal to '<agent>'s gripper is empty': [not applicable]. Line conclusion: [not applicable]

8. [PUT Rule Check 2] For PUT, repeat <obj1>=[], <obj2>=[], <State-1>=[], State of <obj1> in prediction: <State-2>=[]. <State-2> should equal to <State-1>: [not applicable]. Line conclusion: [not applicable]

9. [Other State Check] Repeat items not in <pool>=[bread_slice1]: [bread_slice2, bacon, cheese, tomato, cucumber, ham, beef_patty]. State of these items should not change: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]

[Conclusion] Based on the detailed checks, the prediction is valid.
