Sure, I'll follow the instructions step-by-step.

1. **[Interaction Item Pool]**: Initialize the pool of the food items that the robots are interacting with. It is an empty list at the beginning: `pool={}`.

2. **[Action Forward Rule]**: The state in the [Prediction] is changed by the [Action]. Follow these steps to predict the [Prediction]:
  + List the action of <agent>=Chad and Dave: 
    - Chad's action is WAIT.
      - For WAIT, the state of Chad should not change.
    - Dave's action is PICK bread_slice1.
      - For PICK, repeat action: PICK, <obj>: bread_slice1, <agent>: Dave. 
      - State of Dave should be: "Dave's gripper is holding bread_slice1".
      - State of bread_slice1 should be: "gripped by Dave".
      - Add bread_slice1 to the pool: `pool={bread_slice1}`.

3. **[Prediction Conclusion]**: Conclude the [Prediction] based on the [Action Forward Rule]:
  + The format of the [Prediction] should follow the [Detailed Constraints for State].
  + The food items that are not present in the pool should not change their state.

[Prediction]
[State]
[Food States]
bread_slice1: gripped by Dave
bread_slice2: on left side
bacon: on left side
cheese: on left side
tomato: on right side
cucumber: on right side
ham: on right side
beef_patty: on right side
[Robot States]
1. Chad's gripper is empty
2. Dave's gripper is holding bread_slice1
