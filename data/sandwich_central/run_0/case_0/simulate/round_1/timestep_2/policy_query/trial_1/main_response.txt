1. Action Planning:
To achieve the target state from the current state, we need to follow the [Recipe Order]: [bread_slice1, tomato, cheese, cucumber, bread_slice2]. Both robots currently have their grippers occupied, Chad with the tomato and Dave with bread_slice1. Following the recipe order and accounting for the target state, our logical first steps should involve putting down the food items the robots are currently holding in the correct order to build the vegetarian sandwich.

Since Dave is currently holding bread_slice1 and the target state for bread_slice1 is atop the cutting_board, Dave should PUT bread_slice1 on the cutting_board. Chad is holding the tomato, but since the tomato needs to be atop bread_slice1 according to the recipe and target state, and bread_slice1 is not yet on the cutting_board, Chad should WAIT this turn to allow Dave to place bread_slice1 first. This sequence adheres to the rule that only one robot can PUT each round.

2. Action Conclusion:
The actions are concluded as follows:
- Chad will WAIT.
- Dave will PUT bread_slice1 cutting_board.

3. Action Constraints Check:
- Only Dave is performing a PUT operation, and Chad is WAITING, complying with the constraint that only one robot can PUT each round and there can be up to one WAIT.
- Dave's action to PUT bread_slice1 on the cutting_board is valid because bread_slice1 is currently gripped by him and the target location matches the required next step in assembling the sandwich according to the [Recipe Order].
- The line of actions does not exceed two, and the actions are assigned correctly with Chad listed first and Dave second.

4. Forbidden Action Check:
The chosen action is:
- "NAME Chad ACTION WAIT
- NAME Dave ACTION PUT bread_slice1 cutting_board"

There are no listed [Forbidden Actions], [Policy Mistakes], and [Temporary Mistakes] provided, hence we proceed assuming there's no violation against forbidden or mistaken policies.

5. Action Output:
The final action, considering all checks and the planning phase, is:
EXECUTE
NAME Chad ACTION WAIT
NAME Dave ACTION PUT bread_slice1 cutting_board
