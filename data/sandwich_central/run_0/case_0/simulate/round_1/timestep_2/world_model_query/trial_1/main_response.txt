[Interaction Item Pool]: initialize the pool of the food items that the robots are interacting with. It is an empty list at the beginning: pool={}

[Action Forward Rule]: the state in the [Prediction] is changed by the [Action]. Follow these steps to predict the [Prediction]:

+ List the action of <agent>=[Chad and Dave]:
  - Chad: WAIT
    - For WAIT, the state of Chad should not change
  - Dave: PUT, <obj1>: bread_slice1, <obj2>: cutting_board
    - State of Dave should be 'Dave's gripper is empty'. State of the bread_slice1 should be 'atop cutting_board'. Add bread_slice1 to the pool: pool={bread_slice1}

[Prediction Conclusion]: conclude the [Prediction] based on the [Action Forward Rule]

[State]
[Food States]
bread_slice1: atop cutting_board
bread_slice2: on left side
bacon: on left side
cheese: on left side
tomato: gripped by Chad
cucumber: on right side
ham: on right side
beef_patty: on right side
[Robot States]
1. Chad's gripper is holding tomato
2. Dave's gripper is empty
