1. [Interaction Item Pool]: initialize the pool of the food items that the robots are interacting with. It is an empty list at the beginning: pool={}
  
2. [Action Forward Rule]: the state in the [Prediction] is changed by the [Action]. Follow these steps to predict the [Prediction]:
  + List the action of <agent>=Chad and Dave: 
    - For Chad: action: PICK, <obj>: tomato, <agent>: Chad. State of Chad should be 'Chad's gripper is holding tomato'. State of the tomato should be 'gripped by Chad'. Add tomato to the pool: pool={tomato}
    - For Dave: action: PICK, <obj>: bread_slice1, <agent>: Dave. State of Dave should be 'Dave's gripper is holding bread_slice1'. State of the bread_slice1 should be 'gripped by Dave'. Add bread_slice1 to the pool: pool={tomato, bread_slice1}
  
3. [Prediction Conclusion]: conclude the [Prediction] based on the [Action Forward Rule]
  + The format of the [Prediction] should follow the [Detailed Constraints for State]
  + The food items that are not present in the pool should not change their state

[Prediction] is:
[State]
[Food States]
bread_slice1: gripped by Dave
bread_slice2: on left side
bacon: on left side
cheese: on left side
tomato: gripped by Chad
cucumber: on right side
ham: on right side
beef_patty: on right side
[Robot States]
1. Chad's gripper is holding tomato
2. Dave's gripper is holding bread_slice1
