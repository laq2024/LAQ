Here is the feedback from an action checker. 
[--- Begin ---]
Let's check the [Action] step-by-step based on the given [State] and [Detailed Constraints for Action].

[Extended Recipe Order]: [cutting_board, bread_slice1, tomato, cheese, cucumber, bread_slice2]
<B-Item>=[Chad: tomato; Dave: bread_slice1]

1. [Line Number Check] The line of the actions should equal to two: [yes]

2. [Agent Order Check] The first agent should be Chad and the second agent should be Dave: [yes]

3. [WAIT Number Check] The number of WAIT should be less than or equal to one: [yes]

4. [PUT Number Check] The number of PUT should be less than or equal to one: [yes]

5. [PUT Robot State Check] For PUT action, repeat state of <agent>: [], its gripper cannot be empty: [not applicable]

6. [PICK Side Check] PICK the food item on the side of the robot: [yes]
   - Chad is picking tomato, which is on the right side.
   - Dave is picking bread_slice1, which is on the left side.

7. [PICK Robot State Check] PICK the food item only if the gripper is empty: [yes]
   - Chad's gripper is empty.
   - Dave's gripper is empty.

8. [PICK Food State Check] PICK the food item only if the food item's state is not 'atop <obj>': [yes]
   - Tomato is not atop any other object.
   - Bread_slice1 is not atop any other object.

9. [PUT Availability Check 1] If <obj2> is not cutting_board, repeat <obj2>: [], state of <obj2>: <State-2>=[]. Get food item before <obj2> in the [Extended Recipe Order]: <X-item>=[]. 'atop <X-item>' is: <State-X>=[]. <State-2> should equal to <State-X>: [not applicable]

10. [PUT Availability Check 2] Get <item>s in [State] whose state matches '<item>: atop <obj2>': pool=[]. If no other food item is 'atop <obj2>' (meaning pool is empty), this constraint is valid directly: [not applicable]

11. [PUT Order Check 1] Repeat <obj1>: [], <obj1> should equal to <B-Item>=[]: [not applicable]

12. [PUT Order Check 2] Repeat <obj1>: [], get food item before <obj1> in [Extended Recipe Order]: <Y-item>=[], <obj2>: []. <obj2> should equal to <Y-Item>=[]: [not applicable]

13. [PICK Order Check] For PICK action, robot should PICK the first food item in its [Reachable Items]: [yes]
    - Chad is picking tomato, which is the first item in his reachable items.
    - Dave is picking bread_slice1, which is the first item in his reachable items.

[Conclusion]: The action is valid.
