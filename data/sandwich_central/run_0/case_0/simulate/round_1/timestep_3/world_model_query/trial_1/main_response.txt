Following the instructions step-by-step:

### Step 1: Interaction Item Pool
- Initialize the pool of food items the robots are interacting with. It is an empty list at the beginning: `pool={}`

### Step 2: Action Forward Rule
List the actions of Chad and Dave:
- **Chad's Action**: PUT, tomato, bread_slice1
    - Chad's gripper is empty.
    - Tomato is atop bread_slice1.
    - Add tomato to the pool: `pool={tomato}`
- **Dave's Action**: PICK, cheese
    - Dave's gripper is holding cheese.
    - Cheese is gripped by Dave.
    - Add cheese to the pool: `pool={tomato, cheese}`

### Step 3: Prediction Conclusion
The format of the [Prediction] should follow the [Detailed Constraints for State]:
- The food items that are not present in the pool should not change their state.

[Prediction]:
```
[State]
[Food States]
bread_slice1: atop cutting_board
bread_slice2: on left side
bacon: on left side
cheese: gripped by Dave
tomato: atop bread_slice1
cucumber: on right side
ham: on right side
beef_patty: on right side
[Robot States]
1. Chad's gripper is empty
2. Dave's gripper is holding cheese
```

### Detailed Explanation:
- **bread_slice1**: Remains atop cutting_board.
- **bread_slice2**: Remains on left side.
- **bacon**: Remains on left side.
- **cheese**: Is now gripped by Dave.
- **tomato**: Is now atop bread_slice1.
- **cucumber**: Remains on right side.
- **ham**: Remains on right side.
- **beef_patty**: Remains on right side.
- **Chad's gripper**: Is now empty.
