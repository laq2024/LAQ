I am Bob, and my target is to PUT pink_polygon on panel4. Other robots are Alice and Chad. Alice needs to place blue_square on panel2, and Chad needs to place yellow_trapezoid on panel6. Since my cube, pink_polygon, is already on panel4, which is within my reach, my action for this round should not need to interfere with Alice or Chad's tasks. Therefore, my action will simply be to wait, as moving the pink_polygon is unnecessary. This action should not violate any [Forbidden Actions].

Alice proposes to:
PICK blue_square PLACE panel2

I propose to:
WAIT

Chad, could you confirm if Alice's and my actions are okay with your plan and share your proposed action?
