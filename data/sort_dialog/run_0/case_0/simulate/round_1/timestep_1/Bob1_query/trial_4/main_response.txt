I am Bob, and my target is to PUT pink_polygon on panel4, and other robots are Alice and Chad. Since pink_polygon is already on panel4, which is within my reach, and does not need to be moved, my action to WAIT is appropriate and does not violate any [Forbidden Actions]. Alice has proposed to move the blue_square to panel2, which is within her reach and does not interfere with my zone or tasks. Chad has proposed to WAIT because his cube is already at the correct panel.

Alice proposes to:
PICK blue_square PLACE panel2

I propose to:
WAIT

Chad proposes to:
WAIT

I confirm that the proposed actions align with my understanding and task for this round.

EXECUTE
NAME Alice ACTION PICK blue_square PLACE panel2
NAME Bob ACTION WAIT
NAME Chad ACTION WAIT
