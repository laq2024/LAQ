Alright, let's predict the next [State] based on the given [State] and [Action] by following the [Predicting Instruction] step-by-step.

### 1. [Interaction Item Pool]
List all PICKed objects in the [Action]:
- Alice picks blue_square

Therefore, the <pool> is:
<pool>=[blue_square]

### 2. [Action Forward Rule]
List the action of each agent:
- Alice: PICK blue_square PLACE panel2
- Bob: WAIT
- Chad: WAIT

Based on the action of Alice:
- Since the action is 'PICK blue_square PLACE panel2', the state of blue_square will change to 'blue_square is on panel2'.

Cubes that are not in the <pool>:
- pink_polygon
- yellow_trapezoid

Their states should not change.

### 3. [Prediction Conclusion]
Conclude the [Prediction] based on the [Action Forward Rule].

[State]
[Cube States]
blue_square is on panel2
pink_polygon is on panel4
yellow_trapezoid is on panel6
