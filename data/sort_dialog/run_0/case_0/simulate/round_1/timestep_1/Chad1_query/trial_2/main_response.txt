I am Chad, and my target is to PUT yellow_trapezoid on panel6, and other robots are Alice and Bob. Alice needs to place blue_square on panel2, and Bob needs to place pink_polygon on panel4. Since the yellow_trapezoid is already on panel6, which is within my reach, I don't need to make any moves this round. Alice's proposed action does not conflict with my task, and Bob has chosen to wait, which also does not interfere. 

Therefore, I propose to:
WAIT

Alice proposes to:
PICK blue_square PLACE panel2

Bob proposes to:
WAIT

Can we all confirm that these actions work for everyone? If so, we can execute the plan.
