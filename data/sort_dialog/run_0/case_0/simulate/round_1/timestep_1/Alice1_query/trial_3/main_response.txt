I am Alice, and my target is to PUT blue_square on panel2, and the other robots are Bob and Chad. Bob needs to place pink_polygon on panel4, and Chad needs to place yellow_trapezoid on panel6. Since the blue_square is currently on panel1, which is within my reach, I propose to:

PICK blue_square PLACE panel2

This action should not violate any [Forbidden Actions] as it directly involves moving my designated cube to its target panel within my reachable zone and does not interfere with Bob or Chadâ€™s zones or tasks. Bob has already confirmed his action is to wait since his task does not require any immediate action, and Chad also proposes to wait because his cube is already in the correct position.

Before finalizing, I need to ensure my proposed action aligns with the overall plan and does not conflict with the tasks of Bob and Chad. Bob, Chad, do these actions align with your understanding and plans for this round?
