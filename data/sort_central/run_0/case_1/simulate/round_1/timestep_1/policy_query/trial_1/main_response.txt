### [1. Action Planning]
Let's follow the steps to plan the action step-by-step.

#### [a. Recall]
**Repeat current State**: 
- blue_square: [panel3]
- pink_polygon: [panel5]
- yellow_trapezoid: [panel7]

**Repeat target State**: 
- blue_square: [panel2]
- pink_polygon: [panel4]
- yellow_trapezoid: [panel6]

#### [b. Action Plan]
**Interactive Cubes**:
- repeat the zones' range: 
  - zone1 = [panel1, panel2, panel3]
  - zone2 = [panel3, panel4, panel5]
  - zone3 = [panel5, panel6, panel7]
- initial three empty pools: 
  - pool1 = {{}} 
  - pool2 = {{}} 
  - pool3 = {{}}
- for each cube, get the zones it belongs to, and add it into the pools: 
  - blue_square -> panel3 -> zone1 & zone2 -> pool1 = {{blue_square}}, pool2 = {{blue_square}}, pool3 = {{}}
  - pink_polygon -> panel5 -> zone2 & zone3 -> pool1 = {{}}, pool2 = {{pink_polygon}}, pool3 = {{pink_polygon}}
  - yellow_trapezoid -> panel7 -> zone3 -> pool1 = {{}}, pool2 = {{}}, pool3 = {{yellow_trapezoid}}

**Occupied Panels**:
- List the occupied panels: 
  - panel3, panel5, panel7

**Available Targets**:
- For each robot, repeat its reach range:
  - Alice: zone1 = [panel1, panel2, panel3]
  - Bob: zone2 = [panel3, panel4, panel5]
  - Chad: zone3 = [panel5, panel6, panel7]

**Tip Recall**:
- Tip 1: move the objects to another zone through multiple movements by placing cubes at the intersection (panel3 and panel5).
- Tip 2: do not choose actions for each agent separately, and plan the action jointly by considering the multi-agent system as a whole.

**Plan Process**:
- **Alice**: Alice can move blue_square from panel3 to panel2.
- **Bob**: Bob can move pink_polygon from panel5 to panel4.
- **Chad**: Chad can move yellow_trapezoid from panel7 to panel6.

#### [c. Pre Action Conclude]
Conclude the action according to the Action Planning in the format of Detailed Constraints for Action.

### [2. Action Conclusion]
```

- List the agents that perform PICK PLACE: 
  - Alice
  - Bob
  - Chad
- List the <object> of PICK: 
  - blue_square
  - pink_polygon
  - yellow_trapezoid

**[PICK & PLACE Check]**
- **Alice's action**:

  - List Alice's reach range: [panel1, panel2, panel3].
  - a. [PICK Range Check] List the <object> of PICK: blue_square, and the <location> of this <object> in the current state: panel3. Check if the <location> is in the reach range (Alice's: [panel1, panel2, panel3]): yes. Conclusion: correct.
  - b. [PLACE Range Check] List the <target> of PLACE: panel2. Check if the <target> is in the reach range (Alice's: [panel1, panel2, panel3]): yes. Conclusion: correct.
  - c. [PLACE Target Check] List the <target> of PLACE: panel2. List the objects 'is on <target>' in the current state: pool1 = []. List the PICKed objects in the current state: pool2 = [blue_square]. List the intersection of pool1 and pool2: pool3 = []. Check if the pool1(after removal) is empty: yes. Conclusion: correct.

  - List Bob's action: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel4.
  - List Bob's reach range: [panel3, panel4, panel5].
  - a. [PICK Range Check] List the <object> of PICK: pink_polygon, and the <location> of this <object> in the current state: panel5. Check if the <location> is in the reach range (Bob's: [panel3, panel4, panel5]): yes. Conclusion: correct.
  - b. [PLACE Range Check] List the <target> of PLACE: panel4. Check if the <target> is in the reach range (Bob's: [panel3, panel4, panel5]): yes. Conclusion: correct.
