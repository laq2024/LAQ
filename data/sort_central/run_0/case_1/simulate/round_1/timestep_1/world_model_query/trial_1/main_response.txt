[State Prediction]:
1. List Alice's action: [PICK blue_square PLACE panel2]. List the [Cube States] after Alice's action: [blue_square is on panel2, pink_polygon is on panel5, yellow_trapezoid is on panel7].
2. List Bob's action: [PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel4]. List the [Cube States] after Bob's action: [blue_square is on panel2, pink_polygon is on panel4, yellow_trapezoid is on panel7].
3. List Chad's action: [PICK yellow_trapezoid PLACE panel6]. List the [Cube States] after Chad's action: [blue_square is on panel2, pink_polygon is on panel4, yellow_trapezoid is on panel6].

[State Conclusion]:
[Cube States]:
blue_square is on panel2
pink_polygon is on panel4
yellow_trapezoid is on panel6

[State Constraints Check]:
1. List the lines of [Cube States]: [blue_square is on panel2, pink_polygon is on panel4, yellow_trapezoid is on panel6]. Count the number: [3], and check if it is equal to three. There must be three lines of [Cube States].
2. List the cube items and their locations: [blue_square is on panel2, pink_polygon is on panel4, yellow_trapezoid is on panel6]. Check if their locations are one of the following terms:
   + on panel1
   + on panel2
   + on panel3
   + on panel4
   + on panel5
   + on panel6
   + on panel7
3. List the locations of the cubes: [panel2, panel4, panel6]. It is not allowed to have two cubes on the same panel. Check if they satisfy constraints.
4. List the locations of the cubes: [panel2, panel4, panel6]. The panel name should not contain " " in the middle. For example, use "panel2" instead of "panel 2". Check if they satisfy constraints.

Since all constraints are satisfied, the predicted [State] is valid.

[State Output]:
[State]
[Cube States]
blue_square is on panel2
pink_polygon is on panel4
yellow_trapezoid is on panel6
