Let's follow the [Detailed Constraints for Prediction] step by step:

**Get [Interaction Item Pool]:**
- List all PICKed objects in the [Action]: [blue_square, pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid].

**1. [Header Check]**
- A header titled [State]: yes
- A header titled [Cube States]: yes
- List the Cube States: yes

**2. [Cube Order Check]**
- Cubes must be listed in the following order: [blue_square, pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid]
- Given order: 
  - blue_square
  - pink_polygon
  - yellow_trapezoid
- Order is correct: yes

**3. [Cube Format Check]**
- Each line should be formatted as "<cube_name> is on <panel_name>". Three cube lines in total:
  - blue_square is on panel2
  - pink_polygon is on panel4
  - yellow_trapezoid is on panel6
- Format is correct: yes

**4. [Cube State Check]**
- Repeat cubes' locations: [panel2, panel4, panel6]
- Don't have two cubes on the same panel: [yes]
- Line conclusion: [yes]

**5. [PICK & PLACE Rule Check]**
**5.1 For Alice's action:**
- ACTION: PICK blue_square PLACE panel2
  - <object>=[blue_square]
  - <target>=[panel2]
  - state of <object> in the prediction: [blue_square is on panel2]
  - It should be '<object> is on <target>': [yes]
- Line conclusion: [yes]

**5.2 For Bob's action:**
- ACTION: PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel4
  - <object>=[pink_polygon]
  - <target>=[panel4]
  - state of <object> in the prediction: [pink_polygon is on panel4]
  - It should be '<object> is on <target>': [yes]
- Line conclusion: [yes]

**5.3 For Chad's action:**
- ACTION: PICK yellow_trapezoid PLACE panel6
  - <object>=[yellow_trapezoid]
  - <target>=[panel6]
  - state of <object> in the prediction: [yellow_trapezoid is on panel6]
  - It should be '<object> is on <target>': [yes]
- Line conclusion: [yes]

**[Conclusion]**: All checks passed, the prediction is valid.

- [Interaction Item Pool]: [blue_square, pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid]
- 1. [Header Check]: yes
- 2. [Cube Order Check]: yes
- 3. [Cube Format Check]: yes
- 4. [Cube State Check]: yes
- 5. [PICK & PLACE Rule Check]:
  - 5.1 For Alice's action: yes
  - 5.2 For Bob's action: yes
  - 5.3 For Chad's action: yes
- [Conclusion]: yes
