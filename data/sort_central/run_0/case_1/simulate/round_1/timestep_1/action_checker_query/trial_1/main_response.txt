6. [PICK & PLACE Constraints] For simplicity, we use <agent> to denote the agent's name: [Alice, Bob, Chad]. When checking, please replace <agent> with the real agent's name.
  + If <agent>'s action is PICK PLACE: [yes], repeat <agent>'s reach range: <zone>-<agent>=[panel...]

6.1 [PICK & PLACE Constraints] For Alice's action: [PICK blue_square PLACE panel2], repeat Alice's reach range: <zone>-Alice=[panel1, panel2, panel3]

6.1.b [PLACE Range Check] Repeat <target>: [panel2]. <target> should in the <zone>-Alice: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]

6.1.c [PLACE Target Check] Repeat <target>: [panel2], object whose state is 'is on <target>': <X-object>=[], <pool1>=[blue_square]. <X-object> should be empty: [yes] or in <pool1>: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]

6.2 [PICK & PLACE Constraints] For Bob's action: [PICK pink_polygon PLACE panel4], repeat Bob's reach range: <zone>-Bob=[panel3, panel4, panel5]

6.2.c [PLACE Target Check] Repeat <target>: [panel4], object whose state is 'is on <target>': <X-object>=[], <pool1>=[blue_square, pink_polygon]. <X-object> should be empty: [yes] or in <pool1>: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]

6.3 [PICK & PLACE Constraints] For Chad's action: [PICK yellow_trapezoid PLACE panel6], repeat Chad's reach range: <zone>-Chad=[panel5, panel6, panel7]

6.3.b [PLACE Range Check] Repeat <target>: [panel6]. <target> should in the <zone>-Chad: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]

6.3.c [PLACE Target Check] Repeat <target>: [panel6], object whose state is 'is on <target>': <X-object>=[], <pool1>=[blue_square, pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid]. <X-object> should be empty: [yes] or in <pool1>: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]

[Conclusion] All constraints are satisfied. The actions are valid.
