6.1 [PICK & PLACE Constraints] For Alice's action: [PICK blue_square PLACE panel2], repeat Alice's reach range: <zone>-Alice=[panel1, panel2, panel3]
6.1.a [PICK Range Check] Repeat <object>: [blue_square], location of <object>: <location>=[panel1]. <location> should in <zone>-Alice: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]
6.1.b [PLACE Range Check] Repeat <target>: [panel2]. <target> should in the <zone>-Alice: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]
6.1.c [PLACE Target Check] Repeat <target>: [panel2], object whose state is 'is on <target>': <X-object>=[], <pool1>=[blue_square, yellow_trapezoid]. <X-object> should be empty: [yes] or in <pool1>: []. Line conclusion: [yes]
6.2 [PICK & PLACE Constraints] For Bob's action: [WAIT]
6.3 [PICK & PLACE Constraints] For Chad's action: [PICK yellow_trapezoid PLACE panel6], repeat Chad's reach range: <zone>-Chad=[panel5, panel6, panel7]

6.3.b [PLACE Range Check] Repeat <target>: [panel6]. <target> should in the <zone>-Chad: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]
6.3.c [PLACE Target Check] Repeat <target>: [panel6], object whose state is 'is on <target>': <X-object>=[], <pool1>=[blue_square, yellow_trapezoid]. <X-object> should be empty: [yes] or in <pool1>: []. Line conclusion: [yes]
