### [State Prediction]

1. **Alice's action**: Alice picks the blue_square and places it on panel2.
   - **[Cube States] after Alice's action**:
     - blue_square is on panel2
     - pink_polygon is on panel4
     - yellow_trapezoid is on panel6

2. **Bob's action**: Bob waits.
   - **[Cube States] after Bob's action** (no change):
     - blue_square is on panel2
     - pink_polygon is on panel4
     - yellow_trapezoid is on panel6

3. **Chad's action**: Chad waits.
   - **[Cube States] after Chad's action** (no change):
     - blue_square is on panel2
     - pink_polygon is on panel4
     - yellow_trapezoid is on panel6

4. **Conclude the [Cube States] predicting result according to the format specified in [State Output Instructions]**:
   - blue_square is on panel2
   - pink_polygon is on panel4
   - yellow_trapezoid is on panel6

5. **Conclude the [State] in the format of [Detailed Constraints for State]**:
   - **[State]**
     - **[Cube States]**
       - blue_square is on panel2
       - pink_polygon is on panel4
       - yellow_trapezoid is on panel6

### [State Constraints Check]

1. **List the lines of [Cube States]**:
   - blue_square is on panel2
   - pink_polygon is on panel4
   - yellow_trapezoid is on panel6
   - **Count the number**: 3
   - **Check if it is equal to three**: Yes

2. **List the cube items and their locations**:
   - blue_square is on panel2
   - pink_polygon is on panel4
   - yellow_trapezoid is on panel6
   - **Check if their locations are one of the following terms**:
     - on panel1
     - on panel2
     - on panel3
     - on panel4
     - on panel5
     - on panel6
     - on panel7
   - **Check if they satisfy constraints**: Yes

3. **List the locations of the cubes**:
   - panel2
   - panel4
   - panel6
   - **It is not allowed to have two cubes on the same panel. Check if they satisfy constraints**: Yes

4. **List the locations of the cubes**:
   - panel2
   - panel4
   - panel6
   - **The panel name should not contain " " in the middle. For example, use "panel2" instead of "panel 2". Check if they satisfy constraints**: Yes
