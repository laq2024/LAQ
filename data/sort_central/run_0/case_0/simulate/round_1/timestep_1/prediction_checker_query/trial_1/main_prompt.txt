You are a prediction checker. You will receive a [State], an [Action], and the subsequent [Prediction].
You should follow the instructions in [Detailed Constraints for Prediction] to check if the [Prediction] is valid based on the given [State] and [Action]. Take the mistakes in the [Prediction Mistakes] into consideration.

[State]
[Cube States]
blue_square is on <panel_name>
pink_polygon is on <panel_name>
yellow_trapezoid is on <panel_name>
[Detailed Constraints for Prediction]
Check the following constraints and Fill in blanks in '[]'. Check these constraints one by one: 1, 2... Only get your conclusion according to the results of these checks! 
* Get [Interaction Item Pool]: list all PICKed objects in the [Action]: <pool>=[].
1. [Header Check] A header titled [State] -> A header titled [Cube States] -> List the Cube States
2. [Cube Order Check] Cubes must be listed in the following order: [blue_square, pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid]
3. [Cube Format Check] Each line should be formatted as "<cube_name> is on <panel_name>". Three cube lines in total
4. [Cube State Check] Repeat cubes' locations: []. Don't have two cubes on the same panel
5. [PICK & PLACE Rule Check] For PICK & PLACE, repeat <object>=[], <target>=[], state of <object> in the prediction: [], it should be '<object> is on <target>': []
* When checking, you should repeat the prompt and fill in blanks, replace <obj> and <agent> with their true values, and give the line conclusion (yes/no/not applicable). For example:
4. [Cube State Check] Repeat cubes' locations: [panel1, panel2, panel3]. Don't have two cubes on the same panel: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]
* Constraint 5 may have multiple agents of checking. If so, you should output results separately. For example:
5.1 [PICK & PLACE Rule Check] For Alice's action: [PICK blue_square PLACE panel2], repeat <object>=[blue_square], <target>=[panel2], state of <object> in the prediction: [blue_square is on panel2], it should be '<object> is on <target>': [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]
5.2 [PICK & PLACE Rule Check] For Bob's action: ... 5.3 ...

[Prediction Mistakes]
No prediction mistakes.
Follow the [Detailed Constraints for Prediction] strictly and think step-by-step, then give the [Conclusion]
Now you should check the following [Action] based on the given [State] 
The original state is:
[State]
[Cube States]
blue_square is on panel1
pink_polygon is on panel4
yellow_trapezoid is on panel6

The action is:
EXECUTE
NAME Alice ACTION PICK blue_square PLACE panel2
NAME Bob ACTION WAIT
NAME Chad ACTION WAIT

The prediction is:
[State]
[Cube States]
blue_square is on panel2
pink_polygon is on panel4
yellow_trapezoid is on panel6
