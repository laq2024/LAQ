### [1. Action Planning]

#### [a. Recall]

- **Repeat current State**:
  - blue_square: panel1
  - pink_polygon: panel4
  - yellow_trapezoid: panel6

- **Repeat target State**:
  - blue_square: panel2
  - pink_polygon: panel4
  - yellow_trapezoid: panel6

#### [b. Action Plan]

- **Interactive Cubes**
  - Zones' range:
    - Alice: zone1=[panel1, panel2, panel3]
    - Bob: zone2=[panel3, panel4, panel5]
    - Chad: zone3=[panel5, panel6, panel7]
  - Initial pools:
    - pool1={{blue_square}}
    - pool2={{}}
    - pool3={{yellow_trapezoid}}
  - Repeat the pools:
    - Alice <-> pool1: {blue_square}
    - Bob <-> pool2: {}
    - Chad <-> pool3: {yellow_trapezoid}
  - List the cubes in each robot's zone:
    - Alice: blue_square
    - Bob: None
    - Chad: yellow_trapezoid

- **Occupied Panels**:
  - Occupied panels: panel1, panel4, panel6

- **Available Targets**:
  - Alice: panel1, panel2, panel3
  - Bob: panel3, panel4, panel5
  - Chad: panel5, panel6, panel7

- **Tip Recall**
  - Tip 1: Move objects to avoid collisions. Not applicable since there are no conflicting targets.
  - Tip 2: Move objects through multiple movements. Not needed here.
  - Tip 3: Do not choose actions for each agent separately; plan jointly.

- **Plan Process**
  - Alice picks blue_square from panel1 and places it on panel2.
  - Bob waits.
  - Chad waits.

#### [c. Pre Action Conclude]

- **Action**:
  ```
  EXECUTE
  NAME Alice ACTION PICK blue_square PLACE panel2
  NAME Bob ACTION WAIT
  NAME Chad ACTION WAIT
  ```

### [2. Action Conclusion]

```
EXECUTE
NAME Alice ACTION PICK blue_square PLACE panel2
NAME Bob ACTION WAIT
NAME Chad ACTION WAIT
```

### [3. Action Constraints Check]

#### [Basic Check]

- **Lines of the actions**: [Alice, Bob, Chad]. Count: 3. Check: yes. Conclusion: Correct.
- **Agents that perform WAIT**: [Bob, Chad]. Count: 2. Check: yes. Conclusion: Correct.
- **Agents that perform PICK PLACE**: [Alice]. List the objects of PICK: [blue_square]. Check if all the objects are one of blue_square, pink_polygon, yellow_trapezoid: yes. Conclusion: Correct.
- **Agents that perform PICK PLACE**: [Alice]. List the objects of PICK: [blue_square]. Check if the agents have the same object with each other: no. Conclusion: Correct.
- **Agents that perform PICK PLACE**: [Alice]. List the targets of PLACE: [panel2]. Check if the agents have the same target with each other: no. Conclusion: Correct.

#### [PICK & PLACE Check]

- **Alice's action**: PICK blue_square PLACE panel2
  - **PICK Range Check**
    - Object: blue_square
    - Location: panel1
    - Alice's reach range: panel1, panel2, panel3
    - Check if the location is in the reach range: yes. Conclusion: Correct.
  - **PLACE Range Check**
    - Target: panel2
    - Alice's reach range: panel1, panel2, panel3
    - Check if the target is in the reach range: yes. Conclusion: Correct.
  - **PLACE Target Check**
    - Target: panel2
    - Objects on panel2: None
    - PICKed objects: [blue_square]
    - Intersection: []
    - Pool1(after removal): []
    - Check if the pool1(after removal) is empty: yes. Conclusion: Correct.

### [4. Forbidden Action Check]

- **Chosen action**:
  ```
  EXECUTE
  NAME Alice ACTION PICK blue_square PLACE panel2
  NAME Bob ACTION WAIT
  NAME Chad ACTION WAIT
  ```

- **Forbidden Actions**: None
- **Policy Mistakes**: None
- **Temporary Mistakes**: None

### [5. Action Output]

```
EXECUTE
NAME Alice ACTION PICK blue_square PLACE panel2
NAME Bob ACTION WAIT
NAME Chad ACTION WAIT
```
