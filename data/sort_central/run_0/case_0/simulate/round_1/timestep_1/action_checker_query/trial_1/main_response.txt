* Get PICKed objects: <pool1>=[blue_square]
1. [Line Number Check] The line of the actions should be equal to three: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]
2. [Agent Order Check] The order of the agents' actions should be Alice, Bob, Chad: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]
3. [WAIT Number Check] The number of WAIT actions should be less than or equal to two: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]
4. [PICK Object Check] Repeat <pool1>=[blue_square], there should not have duplicate objects: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]
5. [PLACE Target Check] Get all PLACE target panels: [panel2], there should not have duplicate targets: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]
6.1 [PICK & PLACE Constraints] For Alice's action: [PICK blue_square PLACE panel2], repeat Alice's reach range: <zone>-Alice=[panel1, panel2, panel3]
6.1.a [PICK Range Check] Repeat <object>: [blue_square], location of <object>: <location>=[panel1]. <location> should in <zone>-Alice: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]
6.1.b [PLACE Range Check] Repeat <target>: [panel2]. <target> should in the <zone>-Alice: [yes]. Line conclusion: [yes]
6.1.c [PLACE Target Check] Repeat <target>: [panel2], object whose state is 'is on <target>': <X-object>=[], <pool1>=[blue_square]. <X-object> should be empty: [yes] or in <pool1>: [not applicable]. Line conclusion: [yes]
6.2 [PICK & PLACE Constraints] For Bob's action: [WAIT], there is no PICK PLACE action to check.
6.3 [PICK & PLACE Constraints] For Chad's action: [WAIT], there is no PICK PLACE action to check.

[Conclusion] All actions are valid based on the constraints provided.
