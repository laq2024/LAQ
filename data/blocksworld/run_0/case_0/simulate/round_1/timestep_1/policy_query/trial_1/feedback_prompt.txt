[Checker Instruction]
1. [Action Constraints Check]
   a. [Basic Check]
      - List the line of the actions: [UNSTACK yellow block]. There must be one line of actions. Count the number: [1]. Check if it is equal to one: [yes]. If yes, action is correct; otherwise incorrect. Conclusion: [yes].
      - List the action: [UNSTACK yellow block]. Actions aside from these are not allowed. Check if the action is one of "PICK UP", "UNSTACK", "PUT DOWN" and "STACK ON": [yes]. If yes, action is correct; otherwise incorrect. Conclusion: [yes].

   b. [UNSTACK Check]
      - List the state of your hand: [Empty]. Your hand must be empty. Check if your hand is empty: [yes]. If yes, action is correct; otherwise incorrect. Conclusion: [yes].
      - List the <object> of UNSTACK: [yellow block]. <object>'s state must be on another block. List the state of <object>: [on orange block]. Check if the <object> is 'on <another block>': [yes]. If yes, action is correct; otherwise incorrect. Conclusion: [yes].
      - List the <object> of UNSTACK: [yellow block]. No <object>'s state can be 'on <object>'. Repeat current State: [blue block: on table, orange block: on blue block, red block: on table, yellow block: on orange block]. In the repeated current state, list the blocks whose state is 'on <target>': [none]. List the state of the above block: [], check again if the state of the above block is 'on <target>': []. If check is passed, count the number of above blocks: [0]. Check if the number is zero: [yes]. If yes, action is correct; otherwise incorrect. Conclusion: [yes].

2. [Temporary Conclusion]
   The action "UNSTACK yellow block" is valid based on the current state.

3. [Conclusion Justification]
   The checking process above is complete and the temporary conclusion is correct.

4. [Checker Conclusion]
