[Action Planning]
Repeat current State: [red block: on table, blue block: on table, orange block: on blue block, yellow block: on orange block; hand: Empty]
Repeat target State: [red block: on table, blue block: on table, orange block: on blue block, yellow block: on red block; hand: Empty]

The first observation is that the yellow block needs to be moved from on top of the orange block to on top of the red block. Before we can place the yellow block on the red block, we need to ensure our hand is empty and pick up the yellow block.

Since the hand is empty and the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the first action we can plan is to UNSTACK the yellow block from the orange block.

[Pre Action Conclude]
hand: Empty; red block: on table, blue block: on table, orange block: on blue block, yellow block: on orange block

[Action Conclusion]
EXECUTE
UNSTACK yellow block
