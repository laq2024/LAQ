Here is the feedback from a prediction checker. 
[--- Begin ---]
[Repeat state] and [Repeat action].

+ [Repeat State]: The original state is:
  - Hand State: Empty
  - Block States:
    - blue block: on table
    - orange block: on blue block
    - red block: on table
    - yellow block: on orange block

+ [Repeat action]: The action is:
  - EXECUTE
  - UNSTACK yellow block

[Prediction Format Check]: 

1. [Title Check] - The prediction starts with a header titled [State] which is correct.

2. [Hand State Check] - There is a header titled [Hand State], and the hand state is "Holding yellow block." This meets the requirement that the hand state must be one of ["Empty", "Holding <object>"].

3. [Block States Check] - There is a header titled [Block States], and the states of each block are listed in the prescribed order: blue block, orange block, red block, yellow block. The <block state> of each block matches the constraints of being either "on <object>", "on table", or "in hand".

[Prediction Rule Check]:

1. [Interaction Item Pool] - Initialize the pool of the blocks that the agent is interacting with: pool={yellow block} because the action involves the yellow block.

2. [Action Forward Rule] - The action is "UNSTACK yellow block":
   + The <object> of action is yellow block.
   + The state of yellow block in the Prediction should be changed to "in hand".
   + The state of the hand in the Prediction should be changed to "Holding yellow block".
   + These changes accurately reflect the action of unstacking the yellow block, suggesting that the prediction has properly adjusted the state of the yellow block and the hand state.

3. [Prediction Conclusion] - The blocks not present in the pool (blue block, orange block, and red block) have not changed their state in the Prediction, which matches the criteria that the states of blocks not involved in the action should remain consistent.

4. [Block State Consistency Check] - 
   + Full block list: [blue block, orange block, red block, yellow block].
   + Pool: [yellow block], and removing it from the full block list leaves [blue block, orange block, red block].
   + The state of the remaining blocks in the initial state: 
        - blue block: on table
        - orange block: on blue block
        - red block: on table
   + The Prediction's block state for these blocks matches the initial state, indicating consistency.

5. [Prediction Justification] - Based on the [Action Forward Rule] and the [Block State Consistency Check], the prediction accurately reflects the consequences of the provided action. The hand state and the state of the yellow block are correctly updated, while the states of the other blocks remain unchanged as they were not directly involved in the action.

[Conclusion] - The Prediction follows the detailed constraints for the state and accurately reflects the changes expected from the described action. Therefore, the conclusion is:

[CORRECT]
