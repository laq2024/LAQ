You are an action checker. You should check if the [Action] is valid based on the given [State]. You should follow the [Checker Instruction] to check the [Action]. 
At first, you should first repeat the state and action as follows: [Repeat current State], [Repeat target State], and [Repeat action].
  + [Repeat current State]: [].
  + [Repeat action]: [].
[Checker Instruction]
1. You should follow the [Task Description] carefully to check the [Action].
2. You should output your thinking process step-by-step to follow these steps: [Action Constraints Check], [Conclusion Justification], and [Checker Conclusion].
  + [Action Constraints Check]: follow the check instructions in [Detailed Constraints for Action] to check the [Action] step-by-step. Take the mistakes in the [Action Mistakes] into consideration.
  + [Temporary Conclusion]: output your temporary conclusion about the validity of the [Action]. You should provide a reason for your conclusion. 
  + [Conclusion Justification]: check if the checking process above is complete and check if the temporary conclusion is correct.
  + [Checker Conclusion]: output your final conclusion about the validity of the [Action]. You should provide a reason for your conclusion. If the [Action] is valid, you should output [VALID]. I will use this to extract your results in the following steps.

The following lists the [Task Description], [State Space Definition], and [Action Space Definition]. 
[Task Description]
Task: Rearrange the blocks on the table.
O
Objective: Rearrange the blocks on the table to meet all the constraints in [Target State]. Please note that if a block is not mentioned in [Target State], we have no constraint with respect to it. However, don't hold any blocks in your hand when you consider the [Target State] to be accomplished.

[Target State]
[Hand State]
Empty
[Block States]
blue block: on table
orange block: on blue block
red block: on table
yellow block: on red block


Instructions:
1. You can only perform actions described in [Action Space Definition]. Please do not imagine other actions.
2. This is a Markov Decision Process (MDP). There exists an external environment interacting with the you. 

Constraints:
1. The state of the system must adhere to the prescribed [State Space Definition]! 
2. You should select one action from the provided [Action Space Definition]. 

[State Space Definition]
Define the state of the scenarios: blocks and hand.
1. [Hand State]: The state of the hand. It can be "Empty" or "Holding <object>", where <object> is a block.
2. [Block States]: The state of each block. It can only be one of ["on <object>", "on table", "in hand"]. The blocks should be listed in this order: blue block, orange block, red block, yellow block.

[State Template]
[State]
[Hand State]
<hand state>
[Block States]
blue block: <block state>
orange block: <block state>
red block: <block state>
yellow block: <block state>

[Detailed Constraints for State]
The following paragraphs are the detailed constraints for State. There are three main <check items>: [Title Check], [Hand State Check], and [Block States Check].
1. [Title Check] A header titled [State].
2. [Hand State Check] A header titled [Hand State]. Then, list the Hand State.
  + Hand state must be one of ["Empty", "Holding <object>"], where <object> is a block (e.g. "Holding blue block").
3. [Block States Check] A header titled [Block States]. Then, list the states of each block.
  + Each line represents the state of one block item.
  + The block items must be listed in this order: blue block, orange block, red block, yellow block.
  + The <block state> specifies the state of the block. It can only be "on <object>", "on table" or "in hand" (e.g. "blue block: on table", "orange block: on red block", "red block: in hand").

[Example States]
Example#1:
[State]
[Hand State]
Empty
[Block States]
blue block: on red block
orange block: on blue block
red block: on table
yellow block: on table

[Action Space Definition]
Detail the action space with the stipulated actions: PICK UP, UNSTACK, PUT DOWN, STACK ON.
- PICK UP <object>: Execute if hand is empty, and <object> is on table and no block is on it. Pick up <object> from table. After execution, you will be holding the block.
- UNSTACK <object>: Execute if hand is empty, <object> is on another block and no block is on it. UNSTACK <object> from another block. After execution, you will be holding the block.
- PUT DOWN <object>: Execute if hand is holding <object>. Put down <object> on table. After execution, your hand will be empty.
- STACK <object> ON <target>: Execute if hand is holding <object>, and no block is on <target>. Stack <object> on the top of <target>. After execution, your hand will be empty.

[Action Template]
EXECUTE
<action>

[Action Output Instructions]
1. Commence the output with 'EXECUTE
'. Follow with one action. 
2. Don't add extra symbols at the end of each line, such as periods.

[Action Planning Instructions]
At first, you should first repeat the state as follows: [Repeat current State] and [Repeat target State].
  + [Repeat current State]: [red block: [], blue block: [], orange block: [], yellow block: []; hand: []]
  + [Repeat target State]: [red block: [], blue block: [], orange block: [], yellow block: []; hand: []]
[Constraints]: You can only do one action at a time. Do not choose the action listed in the [Forbidden Actions].
Please output your thinking process step-by-step. You have to follow these steps one by one to plan the [Action]: [Action Plan] and [Pre Action Conclusion].
The most important thing: Follow the instructions step-by-step and ensure each step is completed precisely. Repeat the instructions to not omit any steps.
a. [Action Plan] Plan the [Action] of the agent step by step and list the thinking process.
  + Follow the [Action Output Instructions] and [Detailed Constraints for Action] to plan the [Action] of the agent. You can also take the following tips (Tips 1 and Tips 2) into consideration.
  + [Tips 1]: If you want to PICK or UNSTACK a block with other blocks on it, you should first UNSTACK the blocks on top of it.
  + [Tips 2]: Do not forget that when you are holding a block, you can only PUT DOWN or STACK ON it and you cannot PICK UP or UNSTACK other blocks.
b. [Pre Action Conclude] Conclude the [Action] according to the [Action Planning] in the format of [Detailed Constraints for Action]. Conclusion should be in the order [hand; red block, blue block, orange block, yellow block].

[Detailed Constraints for Action]
[Detailed Constraints] Now, you should follow the constraints one-by-one and step-by-step to check if the action is correct: [Basic Check] and [Action Check].
