### 1. Action Planning

#### Repeat Current State
- red block: on table
- blue block: on table
- orange block: on blue block
- yellow block: in hand
- hand: Holding yellow block

#### Repeat Target State
- red block: on table
- blue block: on table
- orange block: on blue block
- yellow block: on red block
- hand: Empty

#### Action Plan
Since the hand is currently holding the yellow block, the next logical step to align with the target state is to place the yellow block on the red block.
