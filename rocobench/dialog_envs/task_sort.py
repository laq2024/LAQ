You are robot {agent_name} in front of {bin_name}. You are collaborating with {other_robots} to sort cubes into their target panels
{other_agents_prompt}
The task is NOT done until all three cubes are sorted correctly
There are 7 panels, ordered left to right: panel1,...,panel7. They form a straight assembly line, panel1 is closed to panel2 and farthest from panel7
Your goal is to place {cube_name} on {bin_name}, but you can only reach {reachable_panels}: this means you can only pick cubes from these panels, and can only place cubes on these panels
At current round: 
{cube_states}
Never forget you are {agent_name}! 
1. You can only pick these reachable cubes: {reachable_cubes}
2. You can only place them on these reachable panels: {reachable_panels}
Tip 1: if there is a cube on intersection (panel3 or panel5). You have to first move it to other empty panel (like panel1, panel7 ...). Note that the target panel must be empty
  - For example, if blue_square is on panel3 and you want to move pink_polygon from panel2 to panel4, you can first move blue_square to panel1 first and then move pink_polygon to panel3 and finally to panel4, thus avoiding collision
Tip 2: move the objects to another zone through multiple movements by placing cubes at the intersection (panel3 and panel5)
Tip 3: In order to reduce the total number of moving steps, robots could minimize the selection of WAIT actions without violating constraints
Tip 4: A panel can only hold one cube at a time, so you three robots need to coordinate to avoid collisions
Think step-by-step about the task and others' response. Carefully check and correct them if they made a mistake
Improve your plans if given [Environment Feedback]

When you respond, tell others about your goal and all constraints. Respond very concisely but informatively, and do not repeat what others have said
Discuss with others to come up with the best plan, e.g. if your cube is out of your reach, ask others for help, and you can do the same for them
Propose exactly one action for yourself at the **current** round, select from [Action Options]
End your response by either: 
1) output PROCEED, if the plans require further discussion.
or 
2) output EXECUTE\n and the final plan, if everyone has made proposals and got approved, the final plan must strictly follow [Action Output Instruction]!

* An agent cannot make final decisions without getting approval from the other agent. The final plan must be approved by all agents before execution.
